# The Display
I choose one of the many versions of the [MAX7219 dot matrix module][08]
8x8 dot matrix common cathode LED display modules for my display.
I Choose this because of its modest size
(Module size = length x width x height = 12.8 x 3.2 x 1.3 cm),
low working voltage (5V),
and you can chain 2 or more together to create a [scrolling display][10].
I specific used the MAX7219 Dot Matrix Module 4-in-1 Display
(at [Amazon][06] or much cheaper at [Banggood][07] and where I got mine).
